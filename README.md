# TankShellDataAnalysis
The purpose of this project was to process, format, and analyze modeled 3D scanner LiDAR data - particularly from FARO's kubit PointSense exported .csv data.

In it's current state, it reads in raw 3D .csv data that represents the shape deviation (distortion) between ideal cylidrical models and real world scanned aboveground storage tanks. 

Currently it processes and formats the data to be used in Excel for external calculations.
